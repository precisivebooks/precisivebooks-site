# Complete Guide to Remote Online Notarization (RON) in 2026

Remote Online Notarization (RON) has transformed the notary industry, making it possible to notarize documents from anywhere with an internet connection. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about RON services, from how they work to when to use them.

## What is Remote Online Notarization (RON)?

Remote Online Notarization (RON) is a secure, legally recognized method of notarization conducted via video conference. Unlike traditional notarization, RON allows you to complete the entire process remotely using secure video technology and electronic signatures.

**Key Features of RON:**
- Conducted via secure video conference
- Legally recognized and valid
- Available nationwide (where permitted)
- Fast and convenient
- Secure identity verification

## How Does RON Work?

The RON process is straightforward but secure:

### Step 1: Schedule Your Appointment
Contact a RON-certified notary public to schedule your remote notarization session. Many providers, including Precisive Books LLC, offer same-day or next-day appointments.

### Step 2: Receive Secure Video Link
You'll receive a secure video conference link via email. This link is unique to your session and includes encryption for security.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Documents
Before your session:
- Have your unsigned documents ready
- Ensure you have a reliable internet connection
- Prepare valid government-issued identification
- Test your device's camera and microphone

### Step 4: Join the Video Conference
At your scheduled time, join the video conference. The notary will:
- Verify your identity using your ID
- Confirm your identity through knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions
- Review the documents with you
- Witness your electronic signature

### Step 5: Sign Documents Electronically
You'll sign the documents electronically using a secure e-signature platform. The notary witnesses this signing in real-time via video.

### Step 6: Receive Notarized Documents
After completion, you'll receive your notarized documents digitally. The notary's seal and signature are applied electronically, and the documents are legally valid.
